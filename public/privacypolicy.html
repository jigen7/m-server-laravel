In addition, if you make an inquiry to KLab regarding a third party publisher&rsquo;s application, KLab may send Specific Shared Data as well as the inquiry to the applicable third party publisher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that KLab undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets or undergoes bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or analogous proceedings, KLab may transfer all of your information, including Personal Information, to the successor organization in such transition o</span><span class="c2">r as a part of such proceedings. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Your protected interests are considered according to existing legal provisions. &nbsp;External service providers are obliged to treat your data confidentially and securely, and may only use your data as far as this is required to fulfil their duties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the foregoing, KLab may also disclose your Personal Information with other third parties when we have received your consent to such disclosures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure of Information Within the Services</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a user with an account, you may create your own profile, connect with other users of Services, send messages and transmit information through various channels. Please remember that any communications you have via the Services (or through KLab applications or websites or third party publishers utilizing the Services in their own applications or websites) may reveal your screen name and the content of your communications, making this information publicly available to other users. KLab does not assume responsibility, and disclaims liability therefore, for the activities of other users or other third parties with whom you have provided your Personal Information or otherwise have made interaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Location-Based Services</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For location-based Services, KLab may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or mobile device. Unless you explicitly opt-in to permit the use and sharing of your Personal Information regarding your geographic location, your location data will only be collected and used anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you. When you opt-in to location services of a third party publisher&rsquo;s application which utilizes the Services, KLab will share your geographic location with such third party publisher and related application providers in connection with their location services. Please note that some location-based services may require your Personal Information for the feature to work as intended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;cookie&quot; is a data file that is transferred to a user&#39;s computer and is intended to identify that computer. Cookies are used to maintain information about a user&#39;s visit to an application, website or game, such as user names, passwords and individual preferences. The Services may send cookies to your computer when you access the Services. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your Personal Information. That information may be used for a variety of purposes including improving the quality and ease of use of the Services, managing and sending advertising, studying traffic patterns, and understanding the effectiveness of marketing communications.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Services may also collect information using &quot;web beacons,&quot; &ldquo;pixel tags, &quot;gifs&quot; or similar means (collectively, &ldquo;Pixel Tags&rdquo;) in connection with our Services and to collect usage, demographic, geographical location or other data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel not visible to the user, and may be associated with cookies on a user&rsquo;s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow, for example, the counting of users, the delivery of branded services, and the gathering of data to assess the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;The Services may include third party advertisements. These ads may be served by third party advertising companies that deliver cookies to your computer, allowing these companies to track the ads. These companies will consequently be able to recognize your computer when they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to the Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">In particular, Klab has neither responsibility nor influence on the content and design of the linked external pages provided by third parties or the internet appearances which you reached via these pages. The relevant providers are exclusively responsible for the content and design of these Internet appearances as well as their compliance with the provisions of the laws that protect data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the option to disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you visit. Please note, however, that &ldquo;flash&rdquo; cookies operate differently from browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove &ldquo;flash&rdquo; cookies. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use all portions of the Services due to limited functionality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Security of Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify KLab of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your KLab account, the Services allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number), KLab encrypts the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (&quot;SSL&quot;).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;KLab takes commercially reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and customer records but no website or internet transmission is completely secure. </span><span class="c6">The provision of personal data disclosure, whether this is done personally, by telephone or over the Internet, is always associated with risks and no technological system is fully exempt from the possibility of manipulation or sabotage. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">KLab does not guarantee tha</span><span class="c0">t unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. KLab urges you to take necessary steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account every after use. In addition, if your SNS account is hacked, it may lead to unauthorized use of Services that you have procured so be vigilant and careful in keeping your account information secure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. KLab cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted and, any transmission made is at your own risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;KLab processes the information collected from you according to this privacy policy and to the applicable data protection law provisions. &nbsp;All KLab employees are mandated to keep all records and data confidential. &nbsp; In case of payment information (such as a credit card number), KLab, as stated above, encrypts the transmission of that information using the SSL process.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Revocation, Change or Removal of Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request that your Personal Information be changed or deleted, or request for the revocation of an approval previously made by following the process provided in the applicable Services and we will take all reasonable measures to promptly comply with such request. If you delete all of your information, your account may become deactivated. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt-out, KLab may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or your ongoing business relations with KLab.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;You may also email KLab at </span><span class="c7">ph-info@klab.com.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to request the deletion of your Personal Information from KLab&rsquo;s database. KLab will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly honor your request. &nbsp;However, KLab may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes, or when other legal obligations contradict such request.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific Shared Data cannot be retrieved from Preferred Partners after its disclosure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you share information with other users through the communication channels of the Services, you should generally not expect to have any ability to modify or remove such communications.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Links to Other Websites and Services</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Services may contain links to other websites and online services or offers from third parties, such as third party advertisers. If you choose to participate in offer-linked information requests or &ldquo;click&rdquo; an advertisement or other third party link, you may be directed to that third party&rsquo;s website or service and/or be prompted to provide Personal Information. KLab is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or services. If you have any questions about how these other websites or services use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;International Transfer of Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">KLab may transfer information (including Personal Information) that is collected about you to KLab&rsquo;s affiliates, external partners or to other third parties that may be outside of your country. If you are located in the European Union or any other country or jurisdiction, such locations may have laws governing data collection and usage that are less strict or otherwise differ from the laws where the information may be transferred or used. Please note that, by accessing or using the Services, you are transferring information and allowing KLab or others to transfer information, including personal information, to a country that does not have the same data protection or privacy laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your jurisdiction and the use and disclosure of information about you, including Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy Towards Children</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and KLab does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from such children. If KLab discovers that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information from children, KLab shall take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its systems and records as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Privacy Rights under the Applicable Laws of Jurisdiction</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As end-users, you are entitled to request information about any of your data which KLab has stored, as well as its origin and recipient, and the purpose for which it was stored. &nbsp;Your privacy rights are protected by the applicable laws of the Philippines (under its </span><span class="c9"><a class="c10" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.ph%2F2012%2F08%2F15%2Frepublic-act-no-10173%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxAd7YYSECMFh9Y0gqdu3jSDHZnQ">Data Privacy Act of 2012</a></span><span class="c0">), said State being the country of incorporation of KLab Cyscorpions, Inc., as well as the pertinent and relevant international laws. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you have any question about your data, data protection, comments or concerns, or if you wish to correct, block or delete any of your personal information, or you wish to revoke a granted authorization regarding the use of your data, or if you have clarifications &nbsp;regarding this Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to </span><span class="c7">ph-info@klab.com.</span></p><p class="c11"><br><br><br><br><span class="c8">KLab Cyscorpions, Inc. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">3/F Bonifacio High Street Central (C2 Building), 7th Avenue corner 29th Street, Bonifacio Global City 1634 Taguig City, Metro Manila, Philippines</span></p><p class="c16 c17"><span></span>
